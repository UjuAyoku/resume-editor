## Resume-Editor

## Problem
Job seekers often submit generic resumes that fail to align with the specific requirements of the job listings they’re applying for. Recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) typically prioritize resumes that closely match the keywords, skills, and experiences described in job descriptions. As a result, qualified candidates may get overlooked due to lack of resume-job alignment.

## Solution
Resume Editor is an AI-powered web application that intelligently edits and optimizes resumes based on specific job descriptions. It leverages large language models to understand both the job listing and the candidate’s original resume, suggesting or applying edits to improve alignment with the job's requirements.
