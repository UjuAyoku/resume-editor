## Why Resume Optimization Matters

Job seekers often submit generic resumes that fail to align with specific job requirements. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and recruiters prioritize resumes that match:
- Keywords from the job description
- Required skills and experiences
- Industry-specific terminology

**The result?** Qualified candidates get overlooked due to poor resume-job alignment, despite having relevant qualifications.

Resume Optimizer Pro is an AI-powered web application that:
1. Analyzes your resume against target job descriptions
2. Identifies gaps and optimization opportunities
3. Generates tailored improvements with:
   - Keyword optimization for ATS
   - Skills alignment
   - Actionable formatting suggestions
4. Provides an optimized resume ready for submission
