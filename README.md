## Resume Optmizer (Editor)

Job seekers often submit generic resumes that fail to align with the specific requirements of the job listings they’re applying for. Recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) typically prioritize resumes that closely match the keywords, skills, and experiences described in job descriptions. As a result, qualified candidates may get overlooked due to lack of resume-job alignment.

Resume Optimizer is an AI-powered web application that edits and optimizes resumes based on the job description. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to compare the job listing and the user’s resume, and provides an improved and optimized resume with recommendations that align with keywords in the job posting.
